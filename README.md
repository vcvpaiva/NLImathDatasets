# NLImathDatasets
a place for the category theory NLI pairs from the TAC corpus

We have two small datasets:
* seedNLI 279 pairs created by human mathematicians from sentences out of the TAC abstracts
* gpt4NLI 1155 pairs created by GPT4 from sentences out of the TAC abstracts, following the human pattern of E, C, N.

We also have two sets of results of analyzing these pairs using several LLMs.
